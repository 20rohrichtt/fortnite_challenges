              My name is Taylor, although you may better know me on Reddit as
              u/tmant1234. In the past several weeks since I have launched
              fort-friend.com, I have been completely overjoyed by the positive
              support from the Fortnite community: rest assured the site is here
              to stay and will be updated every week. In the first two weeks
              since the launch of the website, I am proud to say there has been
              over 60,000 unique users to the site! I am ecstatic and humbled
              that so many people find my project useful; however, this amount
              of traffic put enough strain on my previous website hosting
              services that it was necessary to pay for higher-end services that
              can support the load on the site. This is what brings us here: I
              have no intention of profiting from FortFriend, simply breaking
              even. Want to donate? Great! I really appreciate any amount to
              help keep the (internet) lights on:{" "}
              <b>you can find my link to Donorbox below.</b> Holding off on
              donating? Thatâ€™s ok too! You will still get complete access to
              fort-friend.com. I look forward to continuing support and keeping
              you up to date with challenges each week! <br />
