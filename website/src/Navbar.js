                My name is Taylor, although you may better know me on Reddit as
                u/tmant1234. In the past several weeks since I have launched
                fort-friend.com, I have been completely overjoyed by the
                positive support from the Fortnite community: rest assured the
                site is here to stay and will be updated every week. In the
                first two weeks since the launch of the website, I am proud to
                say there has been over 60,000 unique users to the site! I am
                ecstatic and humbled that so many people find my project useful;
                however, this amount of traffic put enough strain on my previous
                website hosting services that it was necessary to pay for
                higher-end services that can support the load on the site. This
                is what brings us here: I have no intention of profiting from
                FortFriend, simply breaking even. Want to donate? Great! I
                really appreciate any amount to help keep the (internet) lights
                on: <b>you can find my link to Donorbox below.</b> Holding off
                on donating? Thatâ€™s ok too! You will still get complete access
                to fort-friend.com. I look forward to continuing support and
                keeping you up to date with challenges each week! <br />-Taylor,
                developer of FortFriend
